## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Johanes Setiawan

## About Me:
I am a proficient Full Stack Developer with a solid grasp of basic Full Stack development and Java-based Android development. Currently based in Semarang, Indonesia, I am in the midst of my fifth semester at Dian Nuswantoro University. My fascination with information technology and computers began in junior high schoolâ€”an origin that may seem modest, but has driven me towards a fulfilling path. A significant achievement was securing the LKS championship title during my tenure at SMK (Vocational High School), even though I landed in third place instead of first. I remain dedicated to continuous self-improvement, actively pursuing new knowledge daily to exceed my previous self.
