### About Me:
I am Collage Student with role Full Stack Developer (Basic) , Android Developer Java (Basic), and IT Support (Intermediate) based in Semarang, Indonesia. I'm running my 3rd semester at a campus called Dian Nuswantoro University. My interest in information technology and computers started when I was in junior high school, seems ridiculous if you think about it.
