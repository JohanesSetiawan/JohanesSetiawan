## What I'm All About

My passion lies at the exciting crossroads of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Mobile Development**, especially building awesome experiences with **Flutter**. I'm someone who loves taking complex ideas from the AI realm and translating them into smooth, intuitive applications you can hold in your hand.

It all started with a fascination for computers back in junior high, and that early spark has grown into a drive to constantly learn and build meaningful tech. I thrive on challenges and figuring out how to make technology work smarter and better for people.

## My Go-To Stack

Here's a peek at the tech I'm currently working with and focusing on:

* **Languages:** Python | Dart (Flutter)
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** PyTorch, Gradio, Flask, FastAPI, Flutter
* **Tools:** VS Code, GitHub

*Just for fun, I also occasionally tinker with Swift, Kotlin, and Native PHP to keep the learning curve interesting!*

## Publications
Really excited about this one! I recently worked on a publication titled:

* **"Automatic Speech Recognition for Javanese Language using Wav2Vec 2.0 with Finetuning"** (Currently on-reviewing)

This project was a deep dive into applying cutting-edge AI models to tackle language-specific challenges.
