## About Me:
I am Collage Student with role Full Stack Developer (Basic) , Android Developer Java (Basic), and IT Support (Intermediate) based in Semarang, Indonesia. I'm running my 3rd semester at a campus called Dian Nuswantoro University. My interest in information technology and computers started when I was in junior high school, seems ridiculous if you think about it. A memorable experience was getting an award for the LKS champion while still in SMK (Vocational High School), even though at that time only the 3rd place winner was not the 1st place winner. Now I focus on improving myself by learning new things every day so that I am now better than yesterday.
