**Hi there I'm Johanes Setiawan**

## About Me:
I am a proficient Full Stack Developer and AI Developing with a solid grasp of basic Full Stack development, Java-based Android development, and AI Development. Currently based in Semarang, Indonesia, I am in the midst of my fifth semester at Dian Nuswantoro University. My fascination with information technology and computers began in junior high schoolâ€”an origin that may seem modest, but has driven me towards a fulfilling path. A significant achievement was securing the LKS championship title during my tenure at SMK (Vocational High School), even though I landed in third place instead of first. I remain dedicated to continuous self-improvement, actively pursuing new knowledge daily to exceed my previous self.
